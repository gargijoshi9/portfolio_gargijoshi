            <p>Here are some of the projects I’ve worked on so far:</p>

            <h3>Personal Portfolio Website</h3>
            <p>This is my first major project where I designed and built my own personal portfolio website using <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and a touch of <strong>JavaScript</strong>. It showcases my education, skills, and projects in a clean and responsive design.</p>

            <h3>To-Do List Web App</h3>
            <p>A simple and interactive To-Do list application that allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. Built with <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, this project helped me strengthen my DOM manipulation skills.</p>

            <p>More exciting projects are on the way as I continue learning and building!</p>
