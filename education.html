            <p>I have completed my <strong>Higher Secondary Education</strong> with a strong academic performance, focusing on Science with subjects like Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics.</p>
            
            <p>Currently, I am pursuing a <strong>B-Tech in Information Technology</strong> at <strong>Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT)</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>During my time at PICT, I’ve gained a solid foundation in core computer science subjects such as:

                <ul>
                
                    <li>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</li>
                    
                    <li>Web Development</li>
                    <li>Soft skills </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            

            <p>I’m actively involved in coding, project work, and technical events, which have helped sharpen both my theoretical knowledge and practical skills.</p>
